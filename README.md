# Android 3D Touch - PeekView

![Screenshot](preview.png)

iOS uses [3D Touch](http://www.apple.com/iphone-6s/3d-touch/) as a way to "peek" into full content, such as emails, pictures, web searches, etc. While they have dedicated hardware for this functionality, it is still possible to get similar functionality out of Android, with a long click, rather than the dedicated hardware.

This library aims to create a simple and powerful API to enable 3D Touch style "Peeking" on Android.

## Features

## Installation

There are two ways to use this library:

#### As a Gradle dependency

This is the preferred way. Simply add:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.klinkerapps:peekview:1.0.0'
}
```

to your project dependencies and run `./gradlew build` or `./gradlew assemble`.

#### As a library project

Download the source code and import it as a library project in Eclipse. The project is available in the folder **library**. For more information on how to do this, read [here](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects).
